# HSP 2023 poster

I will present this poster at the [36th Annual Conference on Human Sentence Processing](https://lrdc.pitt.edu/HSP2023/) at the University of Pittsburgh.

We conducted two online experiments with Spanish-English bilinguals to understand the relations between language experience and speech-in-speech performance.
We embedded target sentences in babble spoken by two Spanish or two English talkers at +5 dB SNR.
In one of the two experiments, which only included code-switched sentences, participants pressed the space bar when they heard the target talker switch languages (detection task). 
In both experiments, after listening to each sentence, participants typed as much of the sentence as they could remember (transcription task).
There were 160 sentences in each condition.
For the transcription task, we analyzed accuracy on each individual keyword in each sentence.
For the detection task, we inverse transformed the reaction times (to account for the skewness of this type of data) before analysis.

In this repository, you will find:
- The R Markdown file for the poster
- The HTML output from the markdown file
- The R script where I saved the commands to convert the HTML output into a PDF
- The final PDF of my poster
- Various logos/images; in the images folder, I also have the dialect exposure map from a separate R script
- Plot/graph outputs from the R markdown file in the HSP_2023_files folder
